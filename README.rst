Incremental permanent data archiver with encryption.

Designed for permanently backing up data which does not change frequently,
suitable for write-only storage such as Amazon Glacier.


Installation
============

This requires Python 3.7.

Install serac with::

    pip install serac

If you don't have Python 3.7 installed, you can install it with
`pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_::

    curl https://pyenv.run | bash
    # restart your shell
    pyenv update
    pyenv install 3.7.3
    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv python=python3.7 venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install serac


Usage
=====

Serac must always be run with the config file path as the first argument, then
the command to perform as the second argument.

To run serac::

    /path/to/venv/bin/serac CONFIG COMMAND [OPTIONS]

It is safe to run Serac from a cron job; it will not allow multiple processes to work
with the same config file at the same time.


Commands
--------

After that it accepts one of the following commands:

``test``
    Test the configuration file

``init``
    Initialise an index for a new config by creating the database

``archive``
    Archive any changes since the last archive was performed

``ls [--at=DATE] [--pattern=PATTERN]``
    Show the state of the archive.

    This follows the roughly the same layout as ``ls -l``, with the following
    columns:

        * File permissions
        * Owner (as it will be restored to on this system)
        * Group (as it will be restored to on this system)
        * Size (in kibi/mebib/gibibytes, or in bytes if not specified)
        * Last modified date (this year if not specified)
        * Last modified timestamp (for ease of use in calls to ``ls`` and
          ``restore``)
        * Path (as it was on the originating system)

``restore DESTINATION [--at=DATE] [--pattern=PATTERN]``
    Restore some or all of an archive

    If an archived object is in glacier it will be marked for retrieval.


Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

``DATE``
    This should be a date in one of the following formats:

    * epoch timestamp, eg ``1582165202``
    * ``YYYY-MM-DD``, eg ``2020-02-20``
    * ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS``, eg ``2020-03-20 02:20:02``
    * ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS``, eg ``2020-03-20T02:20:02``

``PATTERN``
    This can either be an exact path to a file, or a partial path to a
    directory.

    Globs are not yet supported.


Configuration
=============

Configure serac using a config file::

    [source]
    # Define the source for the backups

    # List of paths to include and exclude (glob patterns)
    include =
        /path/to/source
        /path/somewhere/else
    exclude =
        /path/to/source/unprocessed
        /path/somewhere/else/*.jpg

    [archive]
    # Define where the backups are saved

    # Backup to a local path
    #storage = local
    #path = /path/to/backup

    # Backup to S3
    storage = s3
    key = 4p1_k3y
    secret = 53cr3t
    bucket = arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket_name
    path = path/within/bucket

    # Encrypt backups with this password
    password = l0ng_s3cr3t

    [index]
    # Define how indexed files are treated

    # Location for index database
    # This should then be backed up by another service, eg duplicity
    path = /path/to/index.sqlite


Contributing
============

To work on serac, install it in a virtual environment::

    mkdir serac
    cd serac
    git clone <path-to-repo> repo
    virtualenv --python=python3.7 venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install pip-tools
    cd repo
    pip-sync

To run during development::

    python -m serac CONFIG COMMAND [OPTIONS]

To run tests::

    cd serac/repo
    . ../venv/bin/activate
    pytest
